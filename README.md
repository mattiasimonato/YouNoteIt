# YouNoteIt
YouNoteIt attempts to bring out youtube's full educational potential. 
It provides a platform for watching tutorials that allows users to take notes while watching the videos, take notes during them and revisit them afterwards.

All you need is a youtube video link and to go to [YouNoteIt](https://notesense.herokuapp.com). Once there, create an account or log in, paste the link on the search bar and start taking notes!
